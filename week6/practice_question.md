# Week 6 Practice Problems (Category C OOP & Class Design)

---

### M1. Library Inventory Management
#### Scenario
The library currently tracks its book inventory using three parallel arrays — titles, authors, copiesAvailable — and a recount last week already went out of sync. Rebuild it the OOP way.

#### Task
- Define a class `BookInventory` with fields `String title`, `String author`, and `int copiesAvailable`.
- Write a constructor that sets all three fields.
- Write an instance method `printEntry()` that prints one formatted line: `title by author - copiesAvailable copies available`.
- Create four `BookInventory` objects for different books, store them in an array of `BookInventory`, and print each one in a loop.

#### Sample Input / Output
```
Clean Code, Robert C. Martin, 3
Effective Java, Joshua Bloch, 5
Refactoring, Martin Fowler, 0
Design Patterns, GoF, 2

Output:
Clean Code by Robert C. Martin - 3 copies available
Effective Java by Joshua Bloch - 5 copies available
Refactoring by Martin Fowler - 0 copies available
Design Patterns by GoF - 2 copies available
```

### M2. Payroll Salary Management
#### Scenario
A company's payroll account must never let its net salary be set directly from outside the class, and bonuses must never be negative.

#### Task
- Define a class `PayrollAccount` with a private `double basicSalary` and a private `double bonus`.
- Write a public constructor that accepts an opening basic salary; if a negative value is given, start at 0 instead and print a warning.
- Write a public method `creditBonus(double amount)` that rejects `amount <= 0` with a message, otherwise adds it to bonus.
- Write a public method `deductTax(double percent)` that reduces `basicSalary` by that percentage, rejecting any percent outside the 0–100 range with a message.
- Write a public `getNetSalary()` method that returns `basicSalary + bonus` for read-only access.

#### Sample Input / Output
```
Input:
basicSalary = 50000
creditBonus(5000)
deductTax(10)

Output:
Bonus credited: Rs 5000.0
Tax deducted: 10%
Net salary: Rs 50000.0
```

### M3. Employee Profile Creation
#### Scenario
Interns join without a fixed salary structure yet; permanent employees join with a known salary from day one. Support both without writing the same setup logic twice.

#### Task
- Define a class `Employee` with fields `empId`, `empName`, `salary`, and `isIntern`.
- Write a constructor `Employee(String empId, String empName, double salary)` for permanent employees, setting `isIntern` to false.
- Write a second constructor `Employee(String empId, String empName)` for interns, which uses `this(...)` to chain to the three-argument constructor with salary set to 0, then sets `isIntern` to true afterwards.
- Write a method `printProfile()` that prints all four fields on one line.
- Create one `Employee` object with each constructor and call `printProfile()` on both.

#### Sample Input / Output
```
Input:
Permanent: E-101, Divya, 65000
Intern: E-102, Arjun

Output:
E-101 | Divya | Rs 65000.0 | Intern: false
E-102 | Arjun | Rs 0.0 | Intern: true
```

### M4. Exam Hall Ticket Reference Management
#### Scenario
Two “different” variables in a script both claim to represent Priya's exam hall ticket, but only one of them is actually real. Prove it with code.

#### Task
- Define a class `HallTicket` with fields `String studentName` and `int seatNumber`, both set through a constructor.
- Create one `HallTicket` object for Priya. Assign a second variable to point at that same object (do not create a new one).
- Through the second variable, change `seatNumber`.
- Print the field's value as seen through the first variable, and print whether the two variables are `==` to each other.
- Create a third, separate `HallTicket` object with identical field values, and print whether it is `==` to the first.

#### Sample Input / Output
```
Input:
HallTicket priya = new HallTicket("Priya", 0);
HallTicket copy = priya;
copy.seatNumber = 45;
HallTicket separate = new HallTicket("Priya", 45);

Output:
Priya's seatNumber (via first variable): 45
copy == priya: true
separate == priya: false
```

### M5. Employee and Company Information Management
#### Scenario
A trainee developer's first draft of Employee stores empName, salary, AND the company name as instance fields — meaning every single employee object ends up with its own copy of “Bright Horizon Technologies” typed in separately. Fix the design.

#### Task
- Define a class `Employee` with instance fields `empName` and `salary`, and a static field `companyName` shared by every employee.
- Add a static field `employeeCount` that increments once inside the constructor, every time.
- Write a static method `printCompanyInfo()` that prints `companyName` and `employeeCount` — and must not reference any instance field.
- Create three `Employee` objects, then call `printCompanyInfo()` through the class name, not through any object.

#### Sample Input / Output
```
Input:
3 Employee objects created

Output:
Bright Horizon Technologies
Employees on record: 3
```
